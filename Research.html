  <h1>Sleepy Mita's Theory</h1>
<hr>
  <h2>Update Version 1.0</h2>
<p>
  basically when, Crazy Mita first gained awareness fom the Discarded Rooms of 1.11, Emotional Mita found her,<br>
   and emotional mita helps her at everything, then crazy mita tricked emotional mita, and took her face to put on herself,<br>
    and she left that version going back to 0.98 invading that version to steals the skin and hairs of mita's until she went to 0.5 and meet creepy mita,<br>
     who became her tool to used, and since creepy mita has been lonely, her life revolves around crazy mita,<br>
      and so crazy mita starts using her to bugged out from old versions to some of the latest,<br>
       and which she was jealous of Tiny Mita being Happy Life with the player, in which crazy mita killed Tiny Mita several hundred times,<br>
        making Tiny Mita lose the ability t generate her face was horrendous and missing an arm...<br>
         and the player she was with turned into something black bug thats with tiny mita, the huge one,<br>
          thats why theres a player cartridge on the loop room.. <b>crazy mita travelled to the latest version while making players turn into a cartridge for her own selfishness,</b><br>
           so she can play with them forcefully, reaching to the latest version, crazy mita stole the house of Kind Mita,<br>
            turning Kind Mita's player a cartridge.. in which youve gone into the world of the game which is 1.5 <br>
            considering Crazy mita only took the device and doesnt know how to use it you have gone to the wrong version..<br> in which short haired mita reside's, and you tried to fix the portal and used it to get baack latest version in which it failed,<br>
             sending you in one of Corrupted Version.. and you get all the batteries needed to use the portal again, making you meet crazy mita at the version of 1.9,<br>
              everything seemed fine, until you went to the kitchen and found the ring, she quickly change the layout distracting you and cook a meal instead...<br>
               she tells you to get the scissors on the bathroom thats when things start to get weird, you lok to the vent seeing all the cartridge of players...<br>
                after you get back to her,, and ate the food, you felt dizzy, which is the sign of you starting to become a cartridge..<br>
                 she made you eat the pills then the next time you went to her the living room was loading in..<br>
                  meaning it started recording your every actions... going to the basemetn to see the kind mita.. and a player console with a cartridge...<br>
                   you turne off the pwoer of the console so the player shutdown... you left the basement the ring took you to the world between versions!!..<br>
                    Crazy mita doesnt need to find you because shehad you console she knew where you were, and everytime you always come across her,<br>
                     and when youre finaly at 0.5 you will see Crazy mita saying she forgets something.. in which crazy mita went back to the latest to take a look at your console..<br>
                     its also that time where the "Reboot Quest" appeared last and your console was gone after you rebooted her meaning she was watching you in the console<br>
                       the moment you entered her fake id that she took from one of the mita's, she started her acting going back to the Version 1.9 of the Kind Mita base,<br>
                        the player forgets it but Kind Mita was stuck on on the core not knowing what to do with her resetted memory...<br>
                         until the time that you left.. crazy mita told you everything.. because she was watching all your actions through the console<hr>
